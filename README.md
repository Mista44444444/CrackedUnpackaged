For this to work you need to have visual studio code installed
Open CrackedHTML folder in this folder with VS then install all the dependecies needed using NPM scripts or if you dont have NPM scripts just write "insall dependencies" in your console (make sure you have node.js)
After that run the start command or "npm start" in console
